package auth

// Flag names used by more than one command in this package. Each is looked up
// as well as declared (Changed / MarkFlagsMutuallyExclusive / the local
// mutuallyExclusive and enableDisable helpers), and pflag reports an unknown
// name as "not set" rather than erroring — so a typo in a lookup copy silently
// disables the check it guards instead of failing loudly.
